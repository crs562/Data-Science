In this repository, I will be adding all the projects that I am working on for Data Science, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Engineer.

## Project 1: Predicting Student Outcome
This Project is based on the idea that present in the paper "Lightweight, Early Identification of At-risk CS1 students". But this paper only describe the predicting outcome for a single computer science course. In this project, I will be designing the prediction model for the degree of the student in any field and also make a model for their job path and all.

I will be using an open data set from the popular site, Kaggle. This Europen soccer database has more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players from European professional soccer seasons from 2008 to 2016. The data set has attributes on weekly game updates, team lineup, and detailed match events. You can download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer. My main goal for this data analysis:
1. Form meaningful player groups
2. Discover other players that are similar to my favorite athlete
3. Form strong teams by analytics

1. How safe is each state?
2. Which state have a largest population?
