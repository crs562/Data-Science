# Data-Science
In this repository, I will be adding all the projects that I am working on for Data Science, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Engineer.

# Project 1: Predicting Student Outcome
This Project is based on the idea that present in the paper "Lightweight, Early Identification of At-risk CS1 students". But this paper only describe the predicting outcome for a single computer science course. In this project, I will be designing the prediction model for the degree of the student in any field and also make a model for their job path and all.
